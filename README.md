# Dotfiles

My ~ away from ~

## Installation

1. Make a backup of what you already have.
2. Run the installer for what you want, e.g. `./install zsh zshrc vimrc vim`
3. Figure out all the stuff that I've forgot to put in this list.

### Packages to install
- iTerm2
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- zsh-autosuggestions
- git
- neovim
- tmux
- jq
- htop
- neofetch (optional)

### TODO
- Add a config folder that have more settings
- Add a custom prompt to start moving away from oh-my-zsh
